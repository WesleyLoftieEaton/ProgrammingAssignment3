run_analysis.R performs the following functions for data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set called df
2. Extracts the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in df
4. Labels df with descriptive variable names
5. Outputs a second, independent tidy data set called tidy.data.txt which reports the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

CodeBook.Rmd describes tidy.data.txt.
